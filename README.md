# Benji Hannam and Brian Keare

This repository contains two directories, connect four and test-app. Test-app is the basic tic-tac-toe project from the tutorial from _https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html_. Connect four is our advancement using what we learned from that tutorial to build a web-app version of connect_four.


## Who did what?
We worked together pair programming style through the tutorial alternating between driving and navigating. Following on from that we continued in the pair programming style for the connect four app.

## What you learned?
We learned the basics of using react to build a web-app, a language that neither of us had never touched. On top of this we began to get familiar with CSS.

## What did not work?
We struggled with actually styling the connect four game to look more like an actual connect four game. We originally had planned to have colored in squares as our pieces but eventually settled for using "X" and "O" to represent the pieces instead. We aimed to publish the project on a github server, but did not, in order to keep the tutorial directory in the repo as well.
